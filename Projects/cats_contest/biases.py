# answer the implicit bias question here!
BIASES = """
There might be biases for the word which the auto correct function provides since auto correct functions would utilize the context of the text given. The word choice differentiates for different people, which might be affected by where they are from, what race or gender they are, speak English in different ways (e.g., English(UK) and English(US), words that different races or genders of people would use). In this function, the bias might exist since we are using the given text “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes” as the sample to build word similarities, and the word choice for the author is specific with his preference. These biases can be solved by introducing a larger amount of random text samples without specific selections.
